# Formatting sourmash for CAMI evaluations

![.github/workflows/bench.yml](https://github.com/luizirber/2020-cami/workflows/.github/workflows/bench.yml/badge.svg)

This repo has the snakemake pipeline for running CAMI 2 evaluations (with [OPAL]),
including indices preparation based on the CAMI 2 databases.

The [sourmash biobox] definition is currently in [sourmash-bio/bioboxes](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/bioboxes)

[OPAL]: https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/OPAL/
[sourmash biobox]: https://quay.io/repository/sourmash.bio/sourmash

## Examples

The snakemake pipeline is continuously built by [GitHub Actions] on every change,
and OPAL reports are published to github pages. Here are the links to access them:
  - [CAMI I low complexity challenge dataset]: [Metalign results] from their repo,
    results for other tools come from the [OPAL repo].
  - [CAMI II mouse gut toy dataset]: I ran Metalign based on the [setup instructions]
    and [running with example data] wiki pages, and other tools results are from the
    official [data repository] for the CAMI 2 challenges.

All processing and analysis scripts were performed using the conda environment specified in `environment.yml`.
To build and activate this environment run:

```bash
conda env create --force --file environment.yml

conda activate cami
```
